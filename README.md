*Need*

India is the No.1 contributor to global road crash mortality and morbidity figures. Every hour, around 16 lives are lost to road crashes in India. In the last decade alone, India lost 1.3 million people to road crashes and another 5.3 million were disabled for life, and yet, drivers fail to give up risky habits.
Hence, this led to our idea of making this revolutionary product to prevent such risk.

*Technology Used*

Python,
Image processing,
Machine learning,
Deep learning 

*Working*

While driving, the driver's behaviour is continuously monitored through 2-D pictures clicked by a camera placed on the dashboard, and the driver is immediately notified if he/she is found to be distracted.

*Features*

Factors that our program takes into consideration include, the usage of a mobile phone, eating and drinking, conversation with co-passengers, self-grooming, reading or watching videos and adjusting the radio or music player. 

*Data Set*

Since, creating our own data set would be a tough task, we prefer a pre-developed data set.
